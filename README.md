# melt-snowmen
A 2D top-down game where you’re trying to melt all of the snowmen before they take over. Based off a concept created for itch.io's Mini Jam 162: Heat. It's a work in progress.

My first exploration with Godot, using a concept with a smaller scope than my pig game.

## Why I built it this way:

- Assets
  - I started learning how to make assets by creating backgrounds from tile maps, creating the snow with Piskel, and making the heat gun with Sketchpad.
  - The menus follow a spring theme, because the player is trying to bring spring about by getting rid of the snowmen.
  - The sounds and snowmen are not my creations.
 
## Future Work:

- Levels
- Styling and positioning of heat gun
